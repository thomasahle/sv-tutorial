<p>SVA provides four operators for composing two sequences:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>s1 and s2</code> — both must match; they start together but may end at different cycles</li>
  <li><code>s1 or s2</code> — at least one must match</li>
  <li><code>s1 intersect s2</code> — both must match <em>and</em> end at exactly the same cycle</li>
  <li><code>s1 within s2</code> — <code>s1</code> starts and ends entirely inside <code>s2</code>'s window</li>
</ul>
<p>Open <code>bus_check.sv</code> and complete two properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>p_transfer</strong> using <code>intersect</code>: once <code>valid</code> is asserted, both <code>valid</code> and <code>ready</code> must hold high for exactly 4 consecutive cycles in lock-step.</li>
  <li><strong>p_complete</strong> using <code>and</code>: after <code>valid</code>, <code>ready</code> must arrive within 4 cycles <em>and</em> <code>done</code> must arrive within 8 cycles — checked independently, they may complete at different times.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>The key difference: <code>intersect</code> requires both subsequences to end at the same cycle; <code>and</code> ends when the <em>longer</em> of the two completes. Use <code>intersect</code> for simultaneous lock-step protocols; use <code>and</code> when two independent conditions must both eventually be satisfied.</p></blockquote>
